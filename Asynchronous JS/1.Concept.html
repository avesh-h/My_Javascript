//Synchronous Example

//In this programme first para text change then alert come and then after ok color of para will changed that means programme will executed synchronously one after one.

let sync = document.querySelector('.sync')

sync.textContent="Hello my name is avesh"

alert('Text is changed!')

//In this example programme will be executed asynchronously paragraph timing will run in backgroud but color of border change first then paragraph is changed
//One task is ruunning in background and then execute the second line of code
